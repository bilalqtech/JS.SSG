intro: Iâ€™m a frontend developer, specializing in complex UI for web apps. I think there are still a lot of ways that design-focused and user-friendly web-tech can *"make the world a better place"* (ðŸ¤®) and I'm enjoying being a part of that process.
intro_posts: Don't know much about me? I'd say these posts are the most "representative" of the work I like to do. They're all deep-dives into something JavaScript-related, and follow a loose "tutorial/explainer" structure.
popular_posts: 'These are the top performers from a page-view standpoint. (a.k.a. what Google thinks is my "best" content... )'

## More about me

I tinker with all sorts of things but my current interests are data-visualisation, web-audio, and modular synthesis. I enjoy building funny little interactive charts, and I cling onto my music-tech roots by creating FX modules and instruments that exist solely in-browser.

Lately I've [gone deep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkiCu8TR7FY) into the world of Eurorack modualar synths, and cannot get enough of making music _without_ computers. But first-and-foremost I make things for the web.

I work as a software engineer at J.P.Morgan, and used to work at [Cronofy](https://docs.cronofy.com) (where we encountered _almost_ every timezone bug imaginable). I co-host the [A Question of Code](https://aqoc.dev) podcast and I spend most of the day glued to Twitter as [@thomashazledine](http://twitter.com/thomashazledine).
