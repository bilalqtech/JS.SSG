_Bit of an eclectic mix this week, but I think that's fine. Sometimes have a unifying theme can be interesting, but more often than not it's just an arbitrary limitation. There's also been more big-money acquisition news in the world of podcasting this week... but hey, sometimes it's good to focus on enjoying the content rather than obsessing over the business model. (I will definitely return to obsessing over the business model next week ðŸ˜›)_

## Three great episodes to listen to this week:

[Offbeat/Psychedelic](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/got-it/id1455935823), _Got it_ (3mins, 2020-01-17)
: Another example of stretching the idea of what a podcast can be, this one is simply a two-person parlour game that's been recorded. Kind of fun to listen to, but mostly useful as inspiration to try it out myself next time I get a chance. Got it? [Find it here](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/got-it/id1455935823).

[Wakandan Econ](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/welcome-to-geektown/e/56027664), _Welcome to Geektown_ (28mins, 2018-08-31)
: If you've seen any of the recent Marvel films, you might be wondering if Wakanda (home of the Black Panther) could ever really exist. Could a super-secret but highly-developed country become the most technologically advanced nation on the planet? The podcast looks at that question from an economic perspective. This one might cross the line from "nerd" to "geek", but the inclusion of actual economic theory from an actual economics professor means it's something I'm comfortable including here.

[Python in supply chains: oil rigs, rockets, and lettuce](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/270/python-in-supply-chains-oil-rigs-rockets-and-lettuce), _Talk Python_ (122mins, 2020-06-25)
: This week my brother Ed and I had the pleasure of chatting to Michael Kennedy, host of the _Talk Python_ podcast (the chat was for an episode of our own show, _A Question of Code_ - you should check it out). He's a charming and eloquent guy, and his show is well worth a listen. It highlights fascinating real-world applications of the Python programming language, lending a dash of context to a subject that can so often be presented in a clinical and abstract manner.

## Not a podcast, but...

I got properly nerd-sniped this week by a video about painting restoration. Because I spend so much of my time working in front of a computer screen I'm always attracted to tales of creative and skillful "real world" craftsmanship - especially when they happen in a cool-looking workshop. Even if art conservation isn't your bag, stick with it until the presenter starts building a customised work table out of extruded aluminium. Hat-tip to my Dad for pointing me in the direction of this one. [Watch it here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLxDD1xsjHw&feature=youtu.be).

As always, feel free to forward this email to someone you think might like it. And if you've been forwarded this email (by someone awesome, no doubt), you can [sign up for yourself at _podcastsfornerds.com_](https://podcastsfornerds.com/) to be sent all future issues.

Thanks again,
Tom.
