### Why am I writing this newsletter?

I'm probably overly obsessed by podcasts. I'm currently subscribed to way more shows than anyone else I know, with even more individual episodes queued-up for review. Every (sensible) person I know listens to a few, but I definitely listen to too many.

So now I'm trying to turn that bug into a feature.

I can save you time by summarising the best episodes I've listened to lately. There's loads of fantastic stuff out there, but you have to listen to a lot of average episodes to be sure of hearing the good bits. Let me do that digging for you.
