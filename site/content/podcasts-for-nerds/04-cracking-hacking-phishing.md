_"Hacker" is a word with several meanings. In the vernacular, it's taken to mean a tech-savvy bad-actor; "a hacker broke into the bank's database", "the NSA mainframe was hacked", etc. But in the start-up sphere, it just means someone who is creative with technology; "she hacked together her MVP in the garage", "did you see that fantastic hack she made to fix that bug?". This week's issue of [Podcasts for Nerds](https://www.podcastsfornerds.com/) contains both types._

## 3 great podcast episodes I've listened to this week:

[One on One with a Hacker](http://shoptalkshow.com/episodes/special-one-one-hacker/), _Shoptalk Show_ (56mins, 2014-03-24)
: After having had his website "hacked", Shoptalk host Chris Coyier was able to actually interview the person who hacked the site. Seriously, folks; be on your guard for Behavioural Engineering. [Find it here.](http://shoptalkshow.com/episodes/special-one-one-hacker/)

[Hacking classic Nintendo guns and going viral](http://creativecodingpodcast.com/hacking-classic-nintendo-guns-and-going-viral/), _The Creative Coding Podcast_ (46mins, 2016-09-07)
: Seb Lee-Delisle is a digital marker/artist/inventor who's laser events are the stuff of legend. In this episode of Creative Coding (RIP), he does a deep-dive on how he reverse-engineered a Nintendo light-gun for his own creative ends.

[What kind of idiot gets phished?](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all/rnhoww/97-what-kind-of-idiot-gets-phished) _Reply All_ (30mins, 2017-05-18)
: In a break from the show's usual format, one of Reply All's producers takes over and attempts to "phish" her colleagues (and bosses!). A eye-opening look at how subtle some attackers can be; even if you're already on the look out! [Find it here](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all/rnhoww/97-what-kind-of-idiot-gets-phished)

## Not a podcast, but...

Jay Forman's eccentric look at the history of London's boroughs is full of great pub-quiz level trivia and also manages to be hilarious (if you like that sort of thing). The two-part series starts with the 11min YouTube video "Why does London have 32 boroughs?", and I recommend you watch them both. [Find them here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daeB46Z4fjs)

Thanks again for reading. I'm investigating different ways to manage this list, which is why this issue looks a little more "fancy" than last week's. What do you think? Do you like the new look, or did you prefer the plain-text version?

Cheers,
Tom.
