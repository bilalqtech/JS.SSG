<!-- ## 3 great episodes I've listened to this week: -->

[Crystal balls and Coronavirus](https://www.numberphile.com/podcast/hannah-fry-coronavirus), _The Numberphile Podcast_ (45mins, 2020-04-10)
: Numberphile is a YouTube channel for maths-nerds, and the spin-off podcast interviews leading mathematicians. In this episode TV-mathematician Hannah Fry looks back on the lessons learned (or not learned) from the 2018 BBC show _Contagion_ (which she presented). That show was a remarkably prescient look at what a modern pandemic would look like. [Find it here](https://www.numberphile.com/podcast/hannah-fry-coronavirus)

[The idea](https://www.relay.fm/b-sides/41), _Backstage_ (28mins, 2020-04-27)
: Myke and Stephen run Relay FM, a podcast network that produces loads of good shows I listen to all the time. They're starting a new show that's a "behind the scenes" look at creating a podcast (meta, I know!). The whole show will be behind a members-only paywall, but the first episode is free for all and really interesting. [Find it here](https://www.relay.fm/b-sides/41)

[The grammar of singular they](https://soundcloud.com/lingthusiasm/43-the-grammar-of-singular-they-interview-with-kirby-conrod), _Lingthusiasm_ (42mins, 2020-04-17)
: Everyone loves shows about linguistics, right? I'll fight people about less vs fewer, oxford commas, etc., but this episode convinced me that I'm probably in the wrong about "singular they" (substituting "him" or "her" with "they" when referring to non-gendered people). It sounds odd, but we need to move with the times. Trigger warning: American voices, and liberal use of "like" - but they're linguistics experts, so they get to decide what's right and wrong.
