Every now and then I get "nerd sniped". Something (a link, an idea, anything) comes out of left-field and instantly becomes an obsession. Take, for example, [Universal Paperclips](https://www.decisionproblem.com/paperclips/). I stumbled on that link who-knows-where, and BAM! Three days' productivity lost, just like that.

Thankfully the most recent example is more benign. Wes Bos' [uses.tech](https://uses.tech/) site is a catalogue of tech bloggers' "uses" pages. I saw that, and had to drop everything to make my own: [tomhazledine.com/uses](https://tomhazledine.com/uses/)

## What is a "uses" page?

In short, a "uses" page is a list of the things you use. Beyond that, it's really up to you. I've chosen to list the hardware I own and use on a regular basis. I covers the basics like computers and laptops, but also other useful things. I have a section for video- and audio-related tech (which I use for [podcasting](https://aquestionofcode.com/) and my occasional [coding videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfi3VtksUcc0Xm9xq1-PSdg)), and also a section that covers my art and design tools (ranging from fancy sketchbooks to The World's Best Pencil[^1]).

## Future plans

I think having (and maintaining) a _Uses_ page is a valuable thing. I love reading about the tools other professionals use, so hopefully someone else (maybe you!) will find value in my list.

So far I've only scratched the surface (I really love _things_, it turns out) and there are already plenty of omissions. The tools I use day-to-day fall in and out of favour periodically, so regular updates will be required. And I haven't even started to list the _software_ I use!

I will revisit [my _Uses_ page](https://tomhazledine.com/uses/) as often as I can, and will actively seek-out the Uses pages of others. You should make one of your own, and then Tweet the link to me. I'd love to see it!

[^1]: It's almost embarrassing how much I love this pencil. The feature set, the weight of it, the finger-feel of the exquisite knurling. Everything about it is perfect.
