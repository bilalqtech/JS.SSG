One of my favourite topics; I've been a mega fan-boy for the medium of podcasting since 2006. I've got some skin in the game now, too. I co-host a podcast about transitioning to a career in tech, _[A Question of Code](https://aquestionofcode.com)_, and run my own podcast-recommendation newsletter, _[Podcasts for Nerds](/podcasts-for-nerds)_.
