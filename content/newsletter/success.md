Thanks so much for signing up to my newsletter. This started as a fun way of nagging my friends about the great podcasts I'd been listening to, and now I use it update people when new content gets released on this site. To have people volutarily sign-up really does mean a lot!

You can find out more about my old podcast-newsletter project on the ["Podcasts for Nerds" landing page](/podcasts-for-nerds) (where you can also read all the old newsletters), and you can find links to the most popular articles in my general archive here:

_Thanks again!_
