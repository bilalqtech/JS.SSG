This is part 3 of the 3-part Getting Started Guide. This page shows you how to manage assets like styles, scripts and images.

Part 1 covers [working with content](/getting-started-content) and part 2 covers [working with templates](/getting-started-templates).

## Overview

In steps 1 and 2 we saw how to convert your raw Markdown content into customised HTML using templates. The next thing to learn is how JS.SSG handles **assets** like stylesheets, client-side JS, and images. These are the things that set the look and feel of your finished website.

JS.SSG can help you with [Sass compilation](#built-in-sass-compilation) and [image optimisation](#optimising-and-re-sizing-images), but you don't _have_ to use these features. JS.SSG wants to work with whatever _you're_ happiest using.

## Using the Public Folder

By default JS.SSG looks for a folder called `/public`. Anything in this folder will be copied into the root of the final build.

This gives you the power to use whatever asset pipeline you like best. As long as the final files are saved into `/public`, you can use webpack, esbuild, whatever!

## Built-in Sass compilation

[Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) is such a common way to pre-compile stylesheets that JS.SSG supports Sass out-of-the-box. Save your `.scss` files into a folder called `/styles`, and JS.SSG will compile those styles into production-ready `.css` files and include them in the final build.

```
├── styles/
|   ├── _layout.scss
|   ├── _typography.scss
|   └── app.scss
```

...will be converted into:

```
├── build/
|   └── app.css
```

## Optimising and re-sizing images

Another common task that JS.SSG does out-of-the-box is image optimisation. JS.SSG uses [Sharp](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/) and [SVGO](https://github.com/svg/svgo) to reduce filesizes of your raw images, as well as creating multiple resized versions of raster (`.png`,`.jpg`, etc.) files.

By default JS.SSG look for a folder called `/images` and will process any image files it finds in there.

Images are processed when the `--images` flag is added to the `jsssg` command.

```
├── images/
|   └── hero-image.jpg
```

```bash
yarn jsssg --images
```

```
├── build/
|   ├── images/
|   |   ├── hero-image-100.jpg
|   |   ├── hero-image-200.jpg
|   |   ├── hero-image-600.jpg
|   |   └── hero-image.jpg
```

<Callout title="Images are not created with every build">
    Processing images is a costly (a.k.a. *slow*) operation, and should only be
    run when new images have been added to your project. This is why images are
    **not** processed with every build. `yarn jsssg` *will not* processes your
    images, but `yarn jsssg --images` will.
</Callout>

## Example before-and-after folder structure

An example of how the "raw files" might look for a simple JS.SSG site:

```
.
├── content/
|   └── index.mdx
├── public/
|   └── favicon.ico
├── styles/
|   ├── _module.scss
|   └── app.scss
├── images/
|   └── hero-image.jpg
├── templates/
|   └── Main.jsx
└── package.json
```

The result of running `yarn jsssg --images` in that folder

```
├── build/
|   ├── images/
|   |   ├── hero-image-100.jpg
|   |   ├── hero-image-200.jpg
|   |   ├── hero-image-600.jpg
|   |   └── hero-image.jpg
|   ├── app.css
|   ├── favicon.ico
|   ├── feed.xml
|   ├── index.html
|   └── sitemap.xml
```
