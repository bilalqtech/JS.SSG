<Callout
    title={`Limited (but useful) support as of version ${site.latest.version}`}
>
    JS.SSG currently supports a *limited* set of MDX features, outlined below.
</Callout>

JS.SSG supports content provided with `.mdx` files.

-   [✅ Components](#components-)
-   [✅ JS expressions](#js-expressions-)
-   [⚠️ `export` and `import` for components](#export-and-import-for-components-️)
-   [⚠️ Inline JS expressions](#inline-js-expressions-️)

## MDX features available in JS.SSG

### Components ✅

You can use any component from the `/templates` directory directly inside an MDX file (without needing to `import` anything).

For example, given this folder structure with a `Callout` component file and a `blog-post` MDX file:

```
├── content/
|   └── blog-post.mdx
├── templates/
|   └── Callout.jsx
```

We could then use the `Callout` component within our `blog-post` file:

```

Welcome to my first blog post! This is a placeholder post that I've created to demonstrate the structure of a markdown file.

<Callout title="Something important">
    This section is important, so I want to call it out in a distinctive style.
</Callout>

I can write as much or as little as I want here. I can use markdown formatting to make my text bold, italic, or create links.
```

### JS expressions ✅

When writing markup within a markdown file you can use inline JavaScript.

For example, including this snippet in your file:

```jsx
<h2 style={{ background: "red" }}>{`testing ${new Date().getFullYear()}`}</p>
```

will result in this output:

<h2 style={{ background: "red" }}>{`testing ${new Date().getFullYear()}`}</h2>

<Callout title="In MDX use JSX markup syntax">
    {
        'Because JS.SSG treats MDX file contents as JSX, remember to use JSX syntax when you write inline markup. For example, use `<h2 style={{ fontSize: "2em" }}>` rather than `<h2 style="font-size: 2em;">`'
    }
</Callout>

Inline expressions (i.e. those not contained in JSX markup) are [not supported](#inline-js-expressions-️)

---

## Not supported

### `export` and `import` for components ⚠️

You cannot directly import components or declare components within an MDX file. You can, however, [use any components from the `/templates` directory](#components) without needing to import them

### Inline JS expressions ⚠️

Currently MDX JS expressions created inline within text using braces (`{}`) will not be evaluated. They will just be reproduced as-in in the final output.
