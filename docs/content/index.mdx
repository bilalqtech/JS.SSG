## Quickly and easily turn your markdown content into a fast and customizable website.

JS.SSG is a tool for converting your markdown files into HTML. One of the best things about JS.SSG is that it lets you write your templates in JSX (or vanilla JS, if you prefer) without having to worry about installing or configuring additional build tools. This makes it super easy to create customised and dynamic templates for your website.
