JS.SSG is a tool for converting your markdown files into HTML. One of the best things about JS.SSG is that it lets you write your templates in JSX (or vanilla JS, if you prefer) without having to worry about installing or configuring additional build tools. This makes it super easy to create customised and dynamic templates for your website.

## Highlights

-   Templates are **"just JavaScript"**, so you have complete control
-   Use **JSX** in your templates without any configuration or additional build tools
-   Use **components** in your templates (after all, it's just JS(X))
-   **RSS** feed and **sitemap** are automatically created for you
-   Supports **MDX**, so you can use components within your content
-   Optimizes and resizes your **images** for you
-   Flexible taxonomy system to easily use **tags**, **categories**, and more
