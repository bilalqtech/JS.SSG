Quickly and easily turn your markdown content into a fast and customizable website.

JS.SSG is a tool for converting your markdown files into HTML. One of the best things about JS.SSG is that it lets you write your templates in JSX (or vanilla JS, if you prefer) without having to worry about configuring or installing additional build tools. This makes it super easy to create custom and dynamic templates for your website.

## Getting Started

The "Getting Started" section of the documentation is designed to guide you through the process of setting up a project with JS.SSG and building your first website. It is split into three pages:

<Cards
    cards={[
        {
            title: "Content",
            body: "This page covers the basics of writing your content in markdown or mdx files and includes a brief overview of templates and assets.",
            url: "/"
        },
        {
            title: "Templates",
            body: "This page provides detailed information about how to use and customize the default templates that come with JS.SSG.",
            url: "/"
        },
        {
            title: "Assets",
            body: "This page provides detailed information about how to use and customize the default assets (such as images, CSS, and JavaScript files) that come with JS.SSG.",
            url: "/"
        }
    ]}
/>

1. **Content**: This page covers the basics of writing your content in markdown or mdx files and includes a brief overview of templates and assets.

3. **Assets**: This page provides detailed information about how to use and customize the default assets (such as images, CSS, and JavaScript files) that come with JS.SSG.

Once you have read these pages and have a basic understanding of how JS.SSG works, you can move on to the Advanced Usage page for information about more advanced features of JS.SSG.
